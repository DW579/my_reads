# My Reads - Udacity React Nanodegree Project

First project for the React Nanodegree. My Reads is a book shelf library app that keeps track of the books that a user is currently reading, wants to read in the future, and has read. The landpage has those three shelves. Then in the search page, a user is able to search a book database and add a book to the pervious three shelves. This project was testing the fundamentals of React through rendering UI, state management, lifecycle events, and react router. The app is pulling and pushing book data through the BooksAPI. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
